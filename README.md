# US_Bikeshare
US Bikeshare is a data analytics project, associated with Udacity, where I built a Python command program that interacts with the user as follows to show statistics of the US Bikeshare dataset:
  1- Prompt the user by asking which city, month, and day of the week they want to analyze
  2- Prompt the user by asking if they want to see 5 lines of raw data,
  3- Display that data if the answer is 'yes',
  4- Continue iterating these prompts and displaying the next 5 lines of raw data at each iteration,
  5- Go to the rest of the script when the user says 'no' or there is no more raw data to display.
  6- Show some statistics of the chosen city, month, and day.
  7- Prompt the user by asking whether they want to restart the program.

## Here are some screenshots for the program:
