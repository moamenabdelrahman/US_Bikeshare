# US_Bikeshare
US Bikeshare is a data analytics project, associated with Udacity, where I built a Python console program that interacts with the user as follows to show statistics of the US Bikeshare dataset:
  * Prompt the user by asking which city, month, and day of the week they want to analyze
  * Prompt the user by asking if they want to see 5 lines of raw data,
  * Display that data if the answer is 'yes',
  * Continue iterating these prompts and displaying the next 5 lines of raw data at each iteration,
  * Go to the rest of the script when the user says 'no' or there is no more raw data to display.
  * Show some statistics of the chosen city, month, and day.
  * Prompt the user by asking whether they want to restart the program.
